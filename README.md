# JuniorFallPortfolioTemplate


Welcome to your **Junior Fall Portfolio repository**.

This project is where you will turn the work you’ve already curated into a **professional, creative, and personal website** that represents **who you are and what you can do** as a programmer.

This is not just an assignment — this is a living portfolio you will continue to build throughout junior and senior year.

---

## Purpose of This Portfolio

Your portfolio should:
- Showcase your **best work**
- Explain **what you learned** and **how you grew**
- Reflect your **personality, interests, and goals**
- Be clear, organized, and professional

You already completed the **Portfolio Curator Activity Guide**.  
This repository is where that content becomes **real**.

---

## What You Are Building

Your site includes:
- A **Home / About** section
- Embedded **projects or CFUs**
- A **written reflection** next to each project
- Navigation to organize your work
- A consistent visual style that you customize

Each project should answer:
- What is this project?
- What skills or concepts did I use?
- Why does this project matter to me?

---

## Repository Structure

You should have files similar to this:
/
├── index.html (home / about page)
├── projects.html (project showcase page)
├── style.css (main stylesheet)
├── images/ (photos, icons, logos)
└── README.md (this file)

Do **not** rename files unless your teacher tells you to.

---

## How to Use the Template

### 1. Start with Structure
Do not delete or break the existing HTML structure.

You should:
- Replace placeholder text with **your curated content**
- Duplicate project blocks when adding new work
- Keep class names the same unless you know why you’re changing them

This template is designed to help you succeed — use it.

---

### 2. Add Projects Correctly

Each project uses the same pattern:
- An embedded project (iframe)
- A reflection next to it
- All wrapped in a card

If one project looks good, **all projects should look good**.

Consistency matters.

---

### 3. Customize With Intention

You are expected to personalize your portfolio.

Good ways to customize:
- Colors and background
- Fonts
- Images and icons
- Spacing and layout tweaks
- Hover effects

Avoid:
- Fixed widths that break the page
- Negative margins
- Random changes without understanding
- Copying someone else’s design exactly

Your goal is **clean + personal**, not flashy chaos.

---

## Creativity Guidelines (Important)

Creative does **not** mean:
- Hard to read
- Over-animated
- Distracting
- Inconsistent

Creative **does** mean:
- Thoughtful color choices
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Personality through design
- Pride in your work

Ask yourself:
> “Does this make my work easier to understand?”

If the answer is yes — you’re on the right track.

---

## Technical Expectations

You are expected to:
- Use **HTML correctly** (nested properly, no missing tags)
- Use **CSS classes**, not IDs, for repeated elements
- Keep your site **responsive**
- Test your site at different screen sizes
- Make sure all links and embeds work

Broken layouts or missing content will affect your grade.

---

## Professional Expectations

This is a **professional portfolio**.

That means:
- No inappropriate language or images
- Reflections written in complete sentences
- Content you would be comfortable showing to:
  - A teacher
  - A mentor
  - A future employer

---

## Getting Help

If something breaks:
1. Check for missing closing tags
2. Check indentation
3. Check your file paths
4. Ask yourself *what changed* right before it broke

If you’re stuck:
- Ask a question
- Show your code
- Be specific

Debugging is part of being a programmer.

---

## Final Reminder

This portfolio represents:
- Your skills
- Your growth
- Your identity as a developer

Take your time.
Be intentional.
Make it yours.

You are building something you will be proud to show.

Good luck — and have fun with it.
